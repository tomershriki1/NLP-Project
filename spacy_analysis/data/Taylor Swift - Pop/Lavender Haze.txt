Meet me at midnight ...

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All of this is new to me

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s sh- they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife

I find it dizzying
They're bringing up my history
But you weren't even listening

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s sh- they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s sh- they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze, I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
