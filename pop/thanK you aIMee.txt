When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwing punches
I was building something
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky
as the blood was gushing
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean Kill
Each time that aIMee stomped across my grave
And then she wrote headlines in the local paper laughing at each baby
step I'd take
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwing punches
I was building something
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky
as the blood was gushing
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill,
your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head

I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars
There's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this
If there hadn't been you

And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues, and one day
your kid comes home singing
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you

Cause all that time you were throwing punches
It was all for nothing
And our town it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, 'thanK you aIMee" to the night sky
And the stars are stunning
Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill,
your words were still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head

thanK you aIMee
thanK you aIMee
