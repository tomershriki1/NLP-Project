The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud

They shake their heads
Saying, "God help her" when I
Tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to
lift a finger, I can fix him
No, really, I can
And only I can

The dopamine races through his brain
On a six lane Texas highway
His hand, so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skillset
He had a halo of the highest grade
He just hadn't met me yet

They shake their heads
Saying, "God help her" when I
Tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to
lift a finger, I can fix him
No, really, I can
And only I can

Good boy, that's right
Come close, I'll show you heaven
If you'll be an angel all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No really I can ...

They shook their heads
Saying, "God help her"
When I told 'em he's my man
But your good Lord didn't need to
lift a finger, I can fix him
No, really, I can

WOAH - maybe I can't.
