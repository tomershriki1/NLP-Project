you
with your words like knives and swords and weapons
that you use againt me
you
will knock me of my feet again
got me feeling like a nothing
you
with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'am wounded
you
picking on the weaker man
well you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you dont know what you dont know
someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you cant hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
you
with your switching sides
and your walk by lies
and your humiliation
you
are pointing out my flaws again
as if i dont already see them
i'll walk with my head down
trying to block you out
cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
cause you cant lead me down that road
and you dont know what you dont know
someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're are ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big mouth opinion
but nobody is listening
washed up and ranting about
the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about
how i cant sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar
and pathetic
and alone in life
and mean
and mean
and mean
and mean
but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
yeah
someday i'll be big enough so you cant hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean someday
i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean someday
i'll be big enough so you cant hit me
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
